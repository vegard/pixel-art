<h2>Texture filtering</h2>

<!-- <span class="aside">This is the marginal note. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Wowzy!</span> -->

<p>
When rendering pixel art on modern screens with high resolutions, we typically need to scale it up. There are many ways to do this.
</p>

<p>
Most hardware and modern rendering frameworks support several types of <em>texture filtering</em>; for example, in OpenGL, you can specify <tt>GL_NEAREST</tt> or <tt>GL_LINEAR</tt> for magnifications. So which texture filter should we use when magnifying pixel art?
</p>

<p>
It turns out that neither of the default options are really good for pixel art. “Nearest neighbour” filtering creates unevenly-sized pixels at non-integer factors of magnification:
</p>

<div class="canvas" data-shader="filtering">
<canvas></canvas>

<form>
<input type="hidden" name="filtering" value="0">
Zoom:<br>
<input type="range" min="1" max="2" value="1" step=".001" class="slider" name="zoom">
</form>
</div>

<p>
“Linear” filtering adds a blurring effect which is too strong and often unwanted for pixel art. It also has a tendency to wash out some of the colour:
</p>

<div class="canvas" data-shader="filtering">
<canvas></canvas>

<form>
<input type="hidden" name="filtering" value="1">
Zoom:<br>
<input type="range" min="1" max="2" value="1" step=".001" class="slider" name="zoom">
</form>
</div>

<p>
What we want is instead something that preserves the appearance of a square pixel by smoothing <em>only the borders between them</em>, rather than smoothing across the whole pixel:
</p>

<div class="canvas" data-shader="filtering">
<canvas></canvas>

<form>
<input type="hidden" name="filtering" value="2">
Zoom:<br>
<input type="range" min="1" max="2" value="1" step=".001" class="slider" name="zoom">
</form>
</div>

<p>
This also has the effect that scaling at exact integer factors gives us perfectly crispy pixels.
</p>

<p>
Of course, some people may occasionally want their pixel art a little blurred, to emulate the CRT effect. That is probably best implemented as a screen effect after compositing the scene, but before scaling it up to the full screen.

You can also compare the three methods by toggling between them:
</p>

<div class="canvas" data-shader="filtering">
<canvas></canvas>

<form>
<input type="hidden" name="filtering" value="1">
Zoom:<br>
<input type="range" min="1" max="2" value="1.5" step=".001" class="slider" name="zoom">
Filtering:<br>
<label><input type="radio" name="filtering" value="0" checked>Nearest neighbour</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="filtering" value="1">Linear</label><br>
<label><input type="radio" name="filtering" value="2">Point</label><br>
</form>
</div>
